Every Thing was ran through Xcode and it works properly there. I have tried it in Visual Studio but I keep getting clang issues. Everything compiles after days of not wanting to, but I used Xcode as my compiler due to clang issues within Visual Studio Code due to me only having a MacBook Air to work with. For each Queue, I implemented its header file with its implementation file which is why there are many files but after getting everything into the right directories I was able to finally compile and get my results. I have included Screenshots of the expected output for this program which was what I got once I ran everything, hopefully, everything works correctly in visual studio on your end. If not I would appreciate some feedback to try to fix it.
